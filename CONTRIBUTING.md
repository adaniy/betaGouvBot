# Contributing

## Collaboration

We loosely follow [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). Pull requests are mandatory, as ```master``` is protected. Pull request reviews are recommended.

## Deployment

BetaGouvBot currently runs on Heroku. Review apps are enabled. Continuous deployment of ```master``` is enabled.

## Documentation

Code should be self-documenting.

Whenever falling short of this ideal, use YARD:
